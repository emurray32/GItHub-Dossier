# Apollo.io API Integration Skill

You are an expert at integrating with Apollo.io's REST API for sales intelligence and engagement. Apollo provides access to 210M+ contacts and 35M+ companies. This skill covers all API endpoints, authentication, parameters, and best practices.

## 1. Authentication

All Apollo API requests require an API key passed in the request header.

```
Header: x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

Two types of API keys exist:
- **Standard API Key**: Access to basic endpoints (enrichment, search).
- - **Master API Key**: Required for advanced endpoints (sequences, contacts, accounts, deals, tasks, users, email accounts). Create via Apollo Settings > Integrations > API.
 
  - For partner integrations, use OAuth 2.0 authorization flow instead.
 
  - ## 2. Rate Limits
 
  - - Rate limits are determined by your Apollo pricing plan.
    - - Apollo uses a **fixed-window rate limiting strategy** (e.g., 200 requests per minute means requests can be made at any interval within a 60-second window).
      - - Check your limits by calling: `POST https://api.apollo.io/api/v1/usage`
        - - Bulk enrichment endpoints are throttled to 50% of individual endpoint per-minute limits, but 100% of hourly/daily limits.
          - - All endpoints return `429 Too Many Requests` when rate limited.
           
            - ## 3. Base URL
           
            - All endpoints use: `https://api.apollo.io/api/v1/`
           
            - ## 4. Pagination (applies to all search endpoints)
           
            - - `page` (integer): Page number to retrieve (starts at 1).
              - - `per_page` (integer): Results per page (default varies, max typically 100).
                - - Display limit: 50,000 records (100 per page x 500 pages). Use filters to narrow results.

# Cold Outreach Templates

Use these templates as a starting point. **Always** customize them based on the specific company and repo data.

## Template 1: Intent Signal (New i18n Config)
**Subject:** `i18n` in [Repo Name] / [Company]

Hi [Name],

I was doing some forensics on [Company]'s GitHub activity and noticed the team just added a `i18n` configuration to the `[Repo Name]` repository.

Usually, when I see this, it means you're gearing up for a significant global expansion. It's a huge milestone.

I've worked with teams at [Competitor/Similar Company] to automate the handoff between devs and translators so that this new config doesn't become a bottleneck.

How are you planning to manage the string updates as the repo grows?

## Template 2: Friction Signal (Hardcoded Strings)
**Subject:** Localization scale in [Repo Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed some recent commits in `[Repo Name]` that include hardcoded strings in the UI components (specifically in the `[Module/File Path]`).

I know how painful it is to retroactively extract those when the "go global" order comes down from product.

We've built some tooling that can help automate the detection and extraction of these strings before they hit production, keeping your `main` branch localization-ready.

Worth a 5-minute chat to see if we can save your team some technical debt?

## Template 3: The "At-a-Glance" Dossier Follow-up
**Subject:** Signal Report: [Company] Global Readiness

Hi [Name],

I put together a quick tactical assessment of [Company]'s localization architecture based on your public GitHub footprint.

Two things jumped out:
1. **High Intent:** Your new `[Library]` implementation shows you're prioritizing speed.
2. **Potential Friction:** The `[Specific File]` structure suggests translation updates might be manual right now.

I'd love to share the full dossier with you. Are you the right person to talk to about localization infrastructure?

Best,
